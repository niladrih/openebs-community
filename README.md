## About the Community Repo Cafe<BR>

This Community repository is the ```central location``` for project info and files (like [our GOVERNANCE contract](GOVERNANCE.md) & [our CONTRIBUTING guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) etc) for the OpenEBS organization. You'll also find a [Top level Issues List](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues) for Organization related issues that span across products/projects. We also provide a [main Discussions forum](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/discussions) where **```everyone```** can collaborate and discuss anything.
<BR>

## Important documents and contacts

This repository contains all the project files for the organization, and the following project files are important for understanding the OpenEBS project, and how we operate:

* [OpenEBS Vision](/VISON.md) Defines the vision, mission statement; what is in-scope and out-of-scope for the project
* [Governance](/GOVERNANCE.md) How the project operates
* [Contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) How to contribute, guidelines for being a contributor
<BR>

## Project Leadership team

This Community is managed by the OpenEBS ```Maintainers``` and <kbd>**Senior leaders**</kbd> within the OpenEBS project team. We liaise with the Linux Foundation and CNCF on project, governance
and operational matters. We curate the daily operations of the project, product, roadmaps, initiatives, all engineering/code activities and all events (including conferences).
<BR>

## Who we are

We are a community of innovative Data Storage engineers that contribute to this project. We are grateful for the major sponsorship provided by [DataCore](https://datacore.com), who donate a team of dedicated Dev/QA/Engineers, Product Mgmt, Marketing, Business and Operational leadership as well as significant engineering infrastructure resources and financial funding. Without DataCore, Inc... OpenEBS would not be the successful product that it is today. OpenEBS is the result of hundreds of amazing individuals, contributors and storage engineers who provide brainstorming ideas, feedback, code reviews and high-quality code to the project. Anyone who is passionate about storage and data is welcome here. <BR>

> [!NOTE]
> CNCF Project status: SANDBOX <BR>
> ```⚠️``` &nbsp; In Jan 2024, under the guidance of CNCF TOC, our project moved from Sandbox level to Archive level, enabling us to implement an extensive restructuring initiative. We are actively working to archive legacy sub projects, repositories and dependencies to a CNCF owned GitHub organization called: [OpenEBS-Archive](https://github.com/openebs-archive), plus updating our governance and operating procedures.<BR>
> ```⚠️``` &nbsp; On 13 June 2024, under guidance of CNCF TOC, our project re-Applied for CNCF promotion from ```Archive``` up to ```Sandbox``` level and was accepted back into
```Sandbox``` in Oct 2024. See our Sandbox promotion [application here](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/104)
>
> * What's changing in the technology stack? The product team is unifying ``` Five ``` major Storage Engines (<kbd>Mayastor</kbd>, <kbd>LocalPV-LVM</kbd>, <kbd>LocalPV-ZFS</kbd>, <kbd>LocalPV-Hostpath</kbd>, <kbd>RawFile</kbd>) into one core OpenEBS code-base.
> * For more information, see [the parent issue]( https://github.com/openebs/openebs/issues/3701) in our main repo for more detail.
